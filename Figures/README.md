**alpha_bar_ridgeplot.svg**: Posterior distributions of the per-capita effect of generic neighbors on each of the four focal species, fixing phosphorous and canopy cover at their average values and averaging over the two reserves. There was little evidence to support the hypothesis that the effect of generic neighbors varies with changes in phosphorous levels or canopy cover.

**ARCA_heatmap_lambda.png**: Heatmap showing the predicted low-density growth rate (LDGR) of *Arctotheca calendula* in relation to phosphorous and canopy cover at each reserve. The predicted LDGR is based on posterior means for regression parameters and therefore does not include uncertainty in the prediction.

**HYGL_heatmap_lambda.png**: Heatmap showing the predicted low-density growth rate (LDGR) of *Hypochaeris glabra* in relation to phosphorous and canopy cover at each reserve. The predicted LDGR is based on posterior means for regression parameters and therefore does not include uncertainty in the prediction.

**TRCY_heatmap_lambda.png**: Heatmap showing the predicted low-density growth rate (LDGR) of *Trachymene cyanopetala* in relation to phosphorous and canopy cover at each reserve. The predicted LDGR is based on posterior means for regression parameters and therefore does not include uncertainty in the prediction.

**WAAC_heatmap_lambda.png**: Heatmap showing the predicted low-density growth rate (LDGR) of *Waitzia acuminata* in relation to phosphorous and canopy cover at each reserve. The predicted LDGR is based on posterior means for regression parameters and therefore does not include uncertainty in the prediction.

**TRCY_alpha_ij_non-generic.svg**: At Perenjori, there is evidence to support that some neighboring species differ from the average neighbor in their competitive effects on *Trachymene cyanopetala*. Additionally, the competitive effect of two of these non-generic species, *Arctotheca calendula* and *Lawrencella rosea*, increases with soil phosphorous while the competitive effect of *Waitzia acuminata* on *T. cyanopetala* increases with increasing canopy cover.

**effects_alpha_generic.svg**: Estimates and 95% credible intervals for regression coefficients in the log-linear model on the competitive effects of generic neighbors on each focal species. For each focal species $i$, we modeled the competitive effect of generic a neighbor $j$ in sub-plot $n$ as $\ln(\alpha_{ij}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{\text{P},n} + \beta_2 x_{\text{C},n} + \beta_3 x_{\text{P},n} x_{\text{C}, n}$, where subscripts P and C denote the measurements for soil phosphorous and canopy cover in sub-plot $n$, respectively.
